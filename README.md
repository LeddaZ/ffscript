# ffscript
A simple script to automate video conversion with FFmpeg

# Usage
First of all, download FFmpeg from [here](https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/) (this script is Windows-only at the moment, macOS and Linux will be supported in the future), then copy ffscript.bat to the bin folder (where ffmpeg.exe is found) and run it.
